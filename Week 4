So for thsi week's  relfection, I want to start with expressing my enjoyemnt for the projects we created in blender this week. I really really enjoyed it and it really felt like
things were actually clicking in my brain, which is rare when it comes to coding. I made a little piggy who I love and named her pinky. 
As for the project, I chose to start with the clock project. After talking to professor after class on Thursday I finally had a good idea of what I actually should do. I was really lost 
originally because I guess I really didn't understand the parameters of the project. The lack of rules just made it more confusing for me. But when I heard about a classmate using movement 
with the "moon" to show the passing of time, I thought it would be cool to do something similar but with a plant. It A LEARNING CURVE. I had such a hard time but I used a lot of google for 
help. I also used chat gpt so answer specific questions. It was hard and I feel like I am still a little confused but I feel some haze lifting.
