Hiiii! I hope this page is actually accessible to everyone, I am still nagivating GitHub. My name is Zaina Usman I am a third year, and from this class I hope to get alot more comfortable
with coding. I have taken a class in the past but I was pretty bad at it lol. I am hoping since for this class the coding is related to art, i'll be a little better at it. 
I just made some ladubugs in p5.js and it was faily simple just a little bit of trial and error.
