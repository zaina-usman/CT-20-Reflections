In all honesty, I am very confused at this point in time. After Thursday's class I realized how much work I am going to have to put in to keep
up with the content since I was very lost during the balloon tutorial. I plan to go to office hours this week and get some help with that. I tried
to do my own thing using the tools shown with the balloons but I didn't know where to start. I am hoping that the TA or Professor can help me 
understand something that fully is not clicked with me because I really want to like this class. So hopefully in the next coming days things 
become clearer.
